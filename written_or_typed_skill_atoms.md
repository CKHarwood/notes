# A Notation for Handwritten or Typed Skill Atoms

In <cite>The Chemistry of Game Design</cite> ([original][1], [backup][2]), Daniel Cook presents a graphical notation for a concept he calls <strong>skill atoms</strong>. This notation and the corresponding model of skill acquisition that Cook presents are useful not only in game design, but also in the design of any system intended to teach skills through actions and feedback.

One shortcoming of Cook's notation is that it is not easy to draw quickly, and it is not possible to type. In using skill atoms to design course curricula I have settled on an alternate notation for handwritten and typed notes. This note describes those alternative notations. The reminder of this note assumes you are familiar with Cook's article and for expediency continues to describe the person learning as a player interacting with a game. Actually thinking of the curriculum as a game is not particularly helpful and can detract from the effectiveness of the final design.

## The four elements of a skill atom

1. The player performs an action that the game accepts as input (Action)
2. The game updates its internal simulation in response to that action (Response)
3. The game provides feedback that the player recognizes as a result of the action (Feedback)
4. The player's mental model changes, often described in terms of their mastery of a skill (Model updated)

## Typewritten notation

<code>
$ Action
f() Simulation
= Feedback
! Model updated
</code>

### Detailed notation (use only where needed)

<code>
+ Positive feedback (repeat the action)
= Neutral feedback
- Negative feedback (avoid the action)

!3 Skill mastered
!1 Skill partially mastered
!0 Skill unexercised
!X Skill burnout
</code>
